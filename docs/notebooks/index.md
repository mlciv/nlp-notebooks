*Natural Language Processing: A Hands-On, Notebook-Based Introduction*

This open textbook is built from **interactive Jupyter notebooks**. Read each chapter
inline, launch it in **Google Colab** with one click, or download it to run locally.
New to the book? Start with the [Preface](../ebook/preface.md).

!!! tip "How to run a chapter"
    At the top of every chapter you'll find a launch bar:

    - **Open in Colab** — run it in your browser on a free Google Colab runtime.
    - **View on GitHub** — read the source.
    - **Download .ipynb** — run it locally in Jupyter or VS Code.
