# Roadmap

This book is **actively growing**. The five chapters below have been class-tested as
course assignments; additional chapters are planned as the open textbook is expanded
under the OU Alternative Textbook Grant 2025–2026.

## Available now

The five class-tested chapters are delivered as interactive notebooks. Although the
course runs **five assignments**, each notebook spans several subtopics, so the chapters
cover considerably more than five discrete topics. The "Inside this chapter" column lists
the subsections found in each assignment notebook.

## Planned chapters

These topics are candidates for future chapters. The list is tentative and will evolve.

- **Evaluation of NLP & LLM systems** — metrics, benchmarks, human evaluation, LLM-as-judge.
- **Post-training & reinforcement learning** — RLHF, reward models, PPO, DPO, and RLAIF.
- **Self-evolving LLMs** — self-improvement, self-training, and self-correction loops.
- **Responsible NLP** — bias, fairness, safety, and limitations.
